## Light Control System

### Description

This is a repository which contains the code and instructions needed to run an
application which allows the user to control an LED light using Django's framework
as a backend and a simple frontend UI as a dashboard. The LED's behavior is enabled
by an LDR sensor all which have been wired and ocnfigured using a Raspberry Pi and 
a breadboard. <br>

the second being that the user can control the LED's behavior by clicking the 'mode' 
button; the LED can then be set to manual/auto.
